  Personal project where I have designed a website for a mock tree surgeon company using figma and then built it using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

  First design and first time using figma learning as I go. I started with building the components up bit by bit and building other components from the smaller broken down components. I then created the pages starting with the mobile desings first adding the components and content then adjusting it to look better. Once I had finished the mobile and desktop I went on to development. 
  I've learnt and played with bootstrap but this was my first proper project with it. I started mobile first just like with the design and used the design as a reference. I knew how the basics but still needed to look up how certain things work and how to do things properly without over complicating the code. I used a few bootstrap 4 web templates as a reference and used to bootstrap site to make sure I understood what I was doing.
